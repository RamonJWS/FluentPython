Context managers are the pythonic way to open and close files and connections.
They are used to open data files, database connections, access cloud resources and more.
They are suited for this work because they automate the opening and closing of resources. If, for some reason, code
working with a database fails then the connection might still be open causing tones of issues.
Context managers allow for automatic entry (opening) and exit (closing) of resources.
